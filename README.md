# CL-I_Assignment_1_PCA
# Feature Transformation:
To use PCA Algorithm for dimensionality reduction.
You have a dataset that includes measurements for different variables on wine
(alcohol, ash, magnesium, and so on). Apply PCA algorithm & transform this data
so that most variations in the measurements of the variables are captured by a small
number of principal components so that it is easier to distinguish between red and
white wine by inspecting these principal components.
